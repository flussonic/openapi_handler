openapi_handler
===============

Cowboy OpenAPI handler.

This is an implementation of API-first approach for Erlang.

First you design OpenAPI schema, then you write independently frontend and backend (in Erlang, of course).


This project will do all (almost all practically required) routing, parsing, validating stuff, etc.

You need to provide your logic handler.
